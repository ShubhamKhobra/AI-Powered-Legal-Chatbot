- Splits them into semantic chunks for retrieval.
- Generates embeddings and stores them in a **FAISS** vector database.
- Retrieves top-matching chunks for a query.
- Uses **GPT-3.5-turbo** (via LangChain) to generate grounded, streamed answers.
- Displays responses in a **Streamlit** chatbot interface.
